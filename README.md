## Design Report

The name of the company/application is "beanBooks".

The application is intended for writers, hobbyists and students who wants to practice writing by given a prompt. "Create, find and share bean-sized stories written by users like yourself! This is a fun application that encourages the writer in everybody and helps you get over your writers block, get in the groove and get your daily writing practice in."

Processes in the site:

1. Follow instructions: Users will customize some default parameters as to the settings of the application, and the "stepper" module in the UI will guide them to input this information one step at a time. Users will input preferred literary genres, set timer and word limits, and indicate whether they want their writing to 
1. Design: After going through customization, users are given a writing prompt and are free to use their creativity to write.
1. Perform a monitored activity: Users may choose to set writing goals with a timer and/or word goal that they want to reach.
1. Absorb information: Users that choose to have their writing posted publicly allows others to be able to browse and read their writings (in the Social page).

Since I used Adobe Xd to prototype, feel free to explore the prototype application including all processes.

For each 10 heuristics:

1. Consistency: The same logo and menu will be used each page, the same accent colours will be used each page. Only Material-UI components will be used in this app and primary default colours will be used.
1. Familiar langauge and metaphors: Words on the buttons will be simple, short and easily recognizable.
1. Simple, aesthetic and functional design: The web app will be simple, with standard icons denoting familiar eleements seen in modern applications.
1. Freedom and control: Most input will be constrained but the user will be able to skip customizations. The user has freedom to write whatever they want.
1. Flexibility: Timer and word goal are "suggestions" and there will be no consequences if the user doesn't finish writing.
1. Recognition over recall: The way to navigate the app is by clicking the top menu, buttons will use easy to recognize icons and words, and layout is similar to existing web app/social platforms.
1. Clear status: On each page, the top menu will show where the user is. For example, app functionalities will show App as underlined, if they are in the Social section to read writing posted by other users, Social will be underlined.
1. Error prevention: Customization input will be constrained to allowed options. For example, genre categories will be predefined, default timer and word goal will be given (will be constrained to within a reasonable range too).
1. Error recovery: For all pages not on the planned routes, there will be a 404 page.
1. Help: There will be some local help elements in the form of text descriptions.
